A text-based-sci-fi-action-adventure-rpg game(or engine).

### Setup Instructions  
1. Obtain git [For Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or follow the instructions [For Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/git.html).  
2. Open git-bash, or terminal on ubuntu.
3. Use `git init` after navigating to your desired development folder.
4. You can either: 
   1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/olgunataberk/SDtG`,  
   2. or add it as a remote repository and then fetch/pull from there `git remote add <reference_name> https://github.com/olgunataberk/SDtG` followed by `git pull <reference_name> master`.
5. Now you are ready to work with the project on your favourite IDE(although I strongly suggest using Eclipse).
