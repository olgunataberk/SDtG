You: "Why are you not working! (Screams at Ion Conductor...)"
Brother: "Oh <Random_Holy_Entity>, stop screaming! Let me take a look... See, there should have been a wire between here and here. Do you want to fit it in?"
You: "I can't believe I missed that one. (Fits wire in...)"
Brother: "You should be more cautious, what if it worked at first and broke down after take off, would you still be able to fix it after you crashed into something?"
You: "Oh come on Brother, it's just a glider. I couldn't crash into things even if I wanted to."
Brother: "You never know for sure little one. Do you remember the accident that happened a year ago?"
You: "It is hard to call that one an accident, and I am not by any means little"
Brother: "And how do you know that?"
You: "Father thinks so."
Brother: "(Laughs...) (Looks at <You>...) (Laughs a little more...)"
You: "(Starts laughing...)"
Brother: ["Promise me that you will be more careful on pre-flight maintenance from now on." "Okay.":(d1+10), "(Pranked!)Okay.":(d1+5)]
(d1>5)You: "I'll race you back home!"
(d1>5)Brother: "I have a bike though..."
(d1<6)You: "I am losing my nonexistent creativity."

You: "(This is Anada, the planet where mountains float. My father is a scientist who works for the Anadian Government
, dad tells me that we were lucky to be on such a strange planet. He says he owes the success of his research to Anada's 
extraordinary planetary structure. I was born here, I grew up amongst the biggest floatains[floating mountain] of Anada.
Strong upstream nitrogen currents from the core of the planet allow for gliding across the skies at ease, given the proper vehicle.
Brother and I made ourselves a glider and named it GliDos, we fly almost every day, but I still wish we could fly higher, higher
than the sky...)"

Father: "How was your day?"
Brother: "Like the usual, we flew a little."
Father: "Where did you fly to this time?"
You: "We flew by the space jumper."
Father: "Oh, so you went to Ganmir. Space jumper... 30 years ago, no one would even think about idea of a space jumper, nevermind
actually making it..."
Brother: "(Interrupts dad...) Okay, we are like really hungry, can we listen to the X years ago stories later?"
Father: "(Slightly dissapointed...) Fine. Get some rest until dinner."
